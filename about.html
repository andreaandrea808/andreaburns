<p>Hello! I am a 25 year old woman living in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I spend my time producing music, promoting and hosting shows, and spending time with my fiance and friends.</p>
<p>I tend to produce jungle and breakcore as a broad statement, but I dabble in styles such as jersey club, baltimore club, and ambient.</p>
<p>I'm a freelance designer and musician, almost entirely self taught. If you'd like to take a look at my works, you can follow <a class="active" href="portfolio">this</a> link </p>
<p>I'm currently enrolled in Fullstack Academy's course to become a web developer. If you'd like to inquire about any freelance work, you can connect with me here and fill out a contact form: <a href="https://andreaandrea.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-my-dead-computer">adrianbvrns@gmail.com</a></p>
